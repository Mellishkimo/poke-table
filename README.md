# poke-table
Multi-page react app featuring a filterable and sortable table of all basic stats and information on the 151 Pokémon from the Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow video games. By clicking a table row, users are routed to an individual page for that pokémon that displays their evolution chart, a stat comparison tool, and a stat ranking tool. The stat comparer allows you to compare that pokémon's base stats to any other pokémon of your choice, selected using a dropdown menu. The user can also type the desired pokémon's name into that dropdown to find it faster. The stat ranking tool allows the user to see where a pokémon's base stats are ranked among a group of their selecting. The ranker defaults to ranking them among all 151 pokémon, but the user can select other options from the dropdown so they can see how the stats rank among pokémon of the same type, or of the same evolutionary stage. Furthermore, the base stat boxes are bordered with a color to indicate the strength of that stat relative to all pokémon- Green indicates a Strong stat (top 33% of all pokémon), Yellow indicates an Average stat (middle 33%), Red indicates a Weak stat (bottom 33%).
